                </div>
                <h4 class="text-body fst-italic mb-4">A year later, the Note that isn't returns. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra brings predictably
                     minor upgrades - camera tweaks here and new chipset there, mostly - but how much can you really improve on the S22 Ultra in
                      just a year? We'll attempt to answer that question and see if the new Ultra can spark excitement in ways the specsheet 
                      couldn't.</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">And it's an expansive specsheet, of course. At the Ultra's heart is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and it's one specifically made for the Galaxies - with higher clock rates than competitors get. The latest Qualcomm top-end chip also comes with efficiency promises, and we would never say no to some extra endurance.

                    The camera sees the introduction of a new 200MP sensor, up from the 108MP resolution of Ultras past. The couple of telephotos remain a staple of the lineup and a standout feature in the market where 10x optical zoom is nowhere to be found outside of the Samsung offerings. The 2023 Ultra is still the only model in the lineup with an autofocusing ultrawide - more of an ongoing rant we just had to include here about the lack of it on the lesser S23s than an actual noteworthy feature of the ultimate Galaxy.
